To install strimert√ºl, choose one of the following methods. If you're not a developer or have particular needs, you should follow the recommended method.

## Recommended: Pre-built binaries

Download the executable for your platform from the [main page](/), put it into a folder of your choosing and run it!

The executable will create files in the folder it's run from, so it's heavily discouraged from running it in default locations like your desktop or your Downloads folder.

## Build from source

To build from source, go to the [project page on GitHub](https://github.com/strimertul/strimertul) and follow the "Development" and "Building" sections in the README file.
