Welcome to strimertül! This software might be a bit hard to use, so this user guide will try to guide you through setting it up and using its main features.

The focus of strimertül is power users, so expect edges to be rougher that you might be used to, as every design choice is made to allow for powerful scripting capabilities over ease of use.

Check the guides on the menu to get started and explore strimertül's features. If you need help or have questions of a more specific nature, feel free to reach out at any of the following places:

- [GitHub issues](https://github.com/strimertul/strimertul/issues)
- [Discord server](https://nebula.cafe/discord)
- [Email at strimertul@nebula.cafe](mailto://strimertul@nebula.cafe)
